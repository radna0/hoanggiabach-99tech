# Overview

This document outlines the specification for a backend API service module that handles user score updates and maintains a live scoreboard. The module ensures secure and real-time updates to the scoreboard, displaying the top 10 users' scores.

# Requirements

1. Scoreboard Display: The website must display the top 10 users' scores in real-time.

2. Live Updates: The scoreboard should update automatically without requiring a page refresh.

3. Score Update Mechanism: Users can perform an action that increases their score. Upon completion, an API call is made to update the score.

4. Security: Prevent unauthorized score updates to mitigate malicious activities.

# API Endpoints

## 1. Update User Score

Endpoint: `POST /api/update-score`

Description: Updates the user's score upon completing an action.

Request Body:

```
{
    "userId": "string",
    "scoreIncrease": "integer"
}
```

- Response:

  - Success: 200 OK

  ```
  {
      "message": "Score updated successfully",
      "newScore": "integer"
  }
  ```

  - Error: 401 Unauthorized or 400 Bad Request

  ```
  {
      "error": "Unauthorized access or invalid request"
  }
  ```

## 2. Get Top Scores

- Endpoint: `GET /api/top-scores`

- Description: Retrieves the top 10 users' scores.

- Response:

  - Success: 200 OK

  ```
    {
        "userId": "string",
        "score": "integer"
    }
  ```

  - Error: 500 Internal Server Error

  ```
    {
        "error": "Unable to retrieve scores"
    }
  ```

# Authentication and Authorization

- JWT Tokens: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure communication. Each API request must include a valid JWT in the header.

- Token Validation: The server validates the token to ensure the request is from an authenticated user.

- Role-Based Access Control: Ensure that only authorized users can update scores.

# Improvements and Considerations

1. Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the score update endpoint.

2. Input Validation: Ensure all inputs are validated to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

3. Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

4. Scalability: Design the system to handle a large number of concurrent users and score updates.

5. Caching: Use caching mechanisms to reduce database load and improve response times for the top scores endpoint.
